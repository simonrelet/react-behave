# react-behave

> A library of React behavioral components.

## ...Of what?

...Of behavioral components.

The components of this library will be focused on functionality and only contain very basic and fully customisable UI.

Here, we focus on **how components work** rather than how they look.

This means:

- You can use any other component library for the UI like [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), [Blueprint](http://blueprintjs.com/), [Element React](https://eleme.github.io/element-react/#/en-US/quick-start), etc.
- Or write your own from scratch.
- You can use CSS-in-JS, CSS modules or basic CSS.
- There is no `<Button />` component.

## Installation

### npm

```sh
npm install --save react-behave
```

### yarn

```sh
yarn add react-behave
```

## Documentaion

The documentation of each component can be found [here](https://github.com/simonrelet/react-libraries/tree/react-behave-0.1.0/packages/react-behave/docs).
